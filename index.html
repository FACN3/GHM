    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>GHM manufactures smart robots to assit you in your everyday life as well as enhancing the experience of your reality.
      By developping advanced AI technologies and using the most sophisticated machine learning algorithms,
      we aim to have a community of robots that serves human kind. Our work is based on the most secret and advanced researches held
      by governement sponsored scientists around the World. Some of our prototypes are so advanced that they have been hired to join our team
      of researchers. Being robots themselves, they are most qualified into identifying flaws and pushing the pace of the evolution of our technologies
      to a rapid speed.</p>
      <p> Each prototype is designed to fill a specific role or purpose in society. We also developp custom prototypes for individuals
      that have specific needs or ambitions. Our clients include governements and secret services, Google, Facebook, NASA and giants
      in the private sector which names we can not disclose.</p>
    <p>Whether you wish to have a simple robot to help you with household tasks or need an AI team to help you achieve some advanced goal,
      we can help! Our robots are highly customizable, our AI intelligences will adapt to anything from beginner users to advanced team of
      developpers.</p>
      <p>Please note though, that we do not take any responsibility for the actions our prototypes take once you have customized them.
      We deliver well balanced, socially adapted and peaceful prototypes. Once you decide to customize the algorithms to your liking, if
      AI turns against you or others in your environment, that is not our responsibility. We do, however, have access to a special "Red Button" in case
      of extreme circumstances that would jeopardize the well-being and safety of citizens around the globe.

# GHM Team Portfolio

This repo contains all the files related to the Team portfolio for Week 1's FAC3 project.

## WHY?

In this project, we are creating a simple one-page website to serve as an introduction card for our developping team. The idea is to create an introductury website that introduces our work and ourselves to potential clients.

The website should include a clear and concise introduction of our work, incite potential clients to hire us as well as give the basic fonctionality required to facilitate contact.

## WHAT?

Our website will be a single html page divided in 3 different sections: About, Team and Contact. 

About: Description of our work as a team of developpers.

Team: An individual biographic description of each member.

Contact: A contact form that allows questions/queries to be sent directly to us from potential clients.

## HOW?

As a start, we have divided the work into 3 main aspects, the overall html, overall css, and the more specific coding of the contact form. Each of us will start with 1 aspect to have a base to start with. Once this is done, we will work as a team on more specific aspects needed. This section of the readme will be updated as the work progresses.

## TECHNOLOGIES IN USE

### Emailjs

Emailjs is a third-party library and application that allows to code email functionalities whithin a website using Javascript and client-side technologies alone. 

Emailjs allows their users to connect their email services. Through a templating system, it is possibile to configure the information that will be sent to the emailjs user and configure it to match the type of form that is being filled by the client on the website. Emailjs also provide security systems such as captach validation and server-side sanitization making it safe to use as a 3rd-party application.

### Mobile First

We tried to create a responsive design for our website in order for it to be viewable through a variety of devices. Being conscious that most of our users will view this website through their mobile devices, we decided to adopt a mobile first strategy to ensure a good browsing experience on small screens and tablets as well as laptops and desktops. 

### Input Sanitization

We aimed to create a web form that is secure to submit to the server and doesn't allow empty fields to be left out by carefully checking the value of each field submitted through the use of regular expressions. 

### Adaptability

Our website has a result of 97% when performing an audit for accessibility using the Accessibility Tools extension in Chrome. We beleive this is sufficient for users with various disabilities to browse our website without any major issues.

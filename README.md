# GHM Team Portfolio

This repo contains all the files related to the Team portfolio for Week 1's FAC3 project.

#2 WHY?

In this project, we are creating a simple one-page website to serve as an introduction card for our developping team. The idea is to create an introductury website that introduces our work and ourselves to potential clients.

The website should include a clear and concise introduction of our work, incite potential clients to hire us as well as give the basic fonctionality required to facilitate contact.

#2 WHAT?

Our website will be a single html page divided in 3 different sections: About, Team and Contact. 

About: Description of our work as a team of developpers.

Team: An individual biographic description of each member.

Contact: A contact form that allows questions/queries to be sent directly to us from potential clients.

#2 HOW?

As a start, we have divided the work into 3 main aspects, the overall html, overall css, and the more specific coding of the contact form. Each of us will start with 1 aspect to have a base to start with. Once this is done, we will work as a team on more specific aspects needed. This section of the readme will be updated as the work progresses.
